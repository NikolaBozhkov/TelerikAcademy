Code:

long CalcCount(int[,] matrix)
{
    long count = 0;
    for (int row=0; row<matrix.GetLength(0); row++)
        if (matrix[row, 0] % 2 == 0)
            for (int col=0; col<matrix.GetLength(1); col++)
                if (matrix[row,col] > 0)
                    count++;
    return count;
}

n * m for the matrix

Complexity: best case O(n), worst case O(n * m), average O(n * (m/2))
Explanation: Best case we only go through the rows, cuz the check fails
Worst case, every check passes and the second "for" is run every time
Average is n * (m/2), simple because the if can pass half the time
