I want to become a banana c# programming specialist.
Programming is great if you like forks and if you hit the bench
often and talk with a lot of people.
Some more extra text... banana, meat, fork, jesus, wtf am I writing, ok,
more forks, now fork, now meat, more c# and programming...That should be enough.
Oo yes and fish!
