Transaction is a sequence of DB operations which are executed as a single operation,
only if all inner operations succeed then the state of the database is saved, otherwise
the transaction fails and nothing is changed.
Example with bank transaction(again):
	If a person sends money to another person and after the money has been withdrawn
	there is an error(without transaction) the money will be lost and the other person won't recieve it
	If the money transaction is done with database transaction, the state is saved and if error occurs
	the state is rowbacked to(no money are lost), only if all operations succeed and the money is recieved,
	then the state is saved and we say that the transaction is complete.
